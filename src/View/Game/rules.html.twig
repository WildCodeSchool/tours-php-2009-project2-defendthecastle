                <p>
                    Defend The Castle is a turn-based strategic card game, the goal being to defend your castle with the cards provided to you. <br>
                    To win your duel, you must beat the enemy card that is attacking you to destroy your castle, but beware the card levels are random.
                    Before starting a game you must choose one of the three pre-built castles.
                </p>
                <p>
